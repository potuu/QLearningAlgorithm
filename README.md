# QLearningAlgorithm

Overall, these algorithms utilize the Q-learning technique to optimize different scenarios by updating Q-values based on rewards and selecting actions accordingly.

The code implements the Q-learning algorithm for different scenarios:

In the first algorithm (v3), the Q-learning algorithm is applied to optimize a Central Pattern Generator (CPG). The CPG's behavior is controlled by a control parameter (k), and the goal is to find the optimal value of k that minimizes the time and error values of the CPG. The Q-learning algorithm iterates over episodes, updating the Q-values based on rewards obtained from the CPG's behavior. The algorithm selects actions based on the reward matrix and Q-values and updates the Q-values using the Q-learning formula. The algorithm terminates when a terminal state is reached, minimizing the error value. The main part of the code performs iterations over different values of k, calculates the CPG's behavior, constructs a reward matrix, initializes a Q-table, and applies the Q-learning algorithm.

In the second algorithm (v9), the Q-learning algorithm is used to find the optimal control parameter for a Central Pattern Generator (CPG). The CPG's behavior is evaluated for different control parameter values, and the time and error values are recorded. The Q-learning algorithm is then applied to train the CPG by updating the Q-values based on rewards obtained from the CPG's behavior. The algorithm explores different actions initially and gradually exploits the learned Q-values to select actions. After training, the optimal control parameter is determined based on the maximum Q-value, and the results are printed.

In the third algorithm (v2), the Q-learning algorithm is applied to find an optimal policy for reaching a goal state in a given environment represented by a reward-state-action matrix. The Q-learning algorithm iterates over episodes, selects actions based on the epsilon-greedy policy, and updates the Q-values based on rewards and the maximum Q-value for the next state. The algorithm terminates when the goal state is reached. The final Q-value table is printed after all episodes are completed.
